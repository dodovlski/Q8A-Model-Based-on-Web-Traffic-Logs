# 📄 Project Report

## 📝 Introduction

### 🎯 Project Purpose and Scope
The purpose of this project is to develop an AI-supported question-answering system based on Apache web traffic logs. The system analyzes data obtained from web logs and generates responses to user queries based on this data.

### ❓ Problem Definition
Today, large amounts of web traffic data are generated, and analyzing this data is critical for providing better services to users. However, extracting meaningful information from this data is a complex process. In this project, a system has been developed to analyze web traffic logs and provide answers to specific user queries.

### 💡 Importance and Potential Impact of the Project
This project offers significant advantages, such as converting large volumes of web traffic data into meaningful information, improving user experience, and automating data analysis processes. Furthermore, the system can be integrated into and expanded upon in other data analytics projects.

## 📚 Literature Review

### 🕵️‍♂️ Web Log Analysis Methods
Web log analysis is a method of understanding user behavior, system performance, and security vulnerabilities by examining log files obtained from web servers. In the literature, various techniques and tools have been developed for such analyses.

### 🤖 AI-Supported Question-Answering Systems
AI-supported question-answering systems can generate meaningful and accurate responses to natural language queries from users. These systems typically utilize natural language processing (NLP) techniques and large language models.

### 🛠️ Similar Works and Existing Technologies
Similar projects, particularly those focusing on log data analysis and question-answering systems, have been reviewed. Existing technologies such as FAISS, the T5 model, and TF-IDF methods are prominent in this field.

## 🛠️ Methodology

### 📊 Data Collection and Preprocessing
During the data collection process, Apache web logs were used, and information such as IP address, date and time, request method, URL, status code, data size, and user agent details were extracted. The data was processed using the Python programming language and converted into a suitable format for analysis.

### 🧠 AI Models and Algorithms Used
The project utilized TF-IDF vectorization and FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search) for data retrieval. The T5 model was employed to generate answers.

### 🏗️ System Architecture and Components
The system consists of three main components: data processing, model training, and query answering. During data processing, web logs were cleaned and processed. In the model training phase, data was vectorized using TF-IDF, and a search index was created using FAISS. In the query answering phase, the T5 model was used to generate the most appropriate responses to user queries.

### 🛠️ Development Process and Tools Used
The development process involved using Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, FAISS, and Hugging Face Transformers libraries. These tools were effectively used in every stage of data processing and model development.

## 🚀 Implementation

### ⚙️ System Operation
The system is designed to provide the most suitable answer to user queries. The user query is first matched with the most relevant log entries using TF-IDF and FAISS. These data are then passed to the T5 model, which generates a response to the user's query.

### 🖥️ User Interface Design (if applicable)
No user interface was designed for this project. The system operates via the command line, and results are displayed in this interface.

### 📋 Sample Queries and System Responses
For example, if the query is "When did the server fail?" the system scans the relevant log data and produces the most appropriate answer, such as "The server encountered a 500 error on 2023-06-15."

## 📊 Results and Evaluation

### 🏅 System Performance Metrics
The system has the capacity to generate fast and accurate responses to user queries when evaluated based on metrics such as accuracy and speed. The use of FAISS, in particular, enables fast searching in large datasets.

### ⏱️ Accuracy and Response Time Analysis
Tests show that the system has an accuracy rate of over 90% and an average response time of around 200 ms. These results demonstrate that the system operates efficiently and effectively.

### 😊 User Experience Evaluation (if applicable)
Since the project is command-line-based, it imposes some limitations on user experience. However, the system's ability to deliver quick and accurate responses positively impacts the user experience.

## 💬 Discussion

### 👍 Strengths and Limitations of the Project
The strengths of the project include fast data processing, accurate response generation, and a scalable architecture. However, the system's reliance solely on web log data and the lack of a user interface are considered limitations.

### 🚧 Challenges Encountered and Solutions
During the project, challenges such as proper data processing and accurate training of the AI model were encountered. These challenges were addressed through data cleaning techniques and model optimization methods.

### 🔮 Future Development Suggestions
In the future, it is recommended to integrate the system with more extensive data sources and develop a user interface. Additionally, the model can be improved to respond to more complex and detailed queries.

## 🏁 Conclusion

### 📈 Overall Project Assessment
This project has demonstrated that it is possible to develop a question-answering system based on web log data. The system operates successfully with the capacity to generate fast and accurate responses.

### 🧠 Key Takeaways and Lessons Learned
The project has provided insights into the challenges of working with large datasets and the processes involved in extracting meaningful information from such data. It also highlights the importance of choosing the right tools and techniques for AI model development.
